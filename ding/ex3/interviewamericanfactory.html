						Why did you pick our film? There's a million films out there.

						Gosh, this is fun. Iwant to know that you guys could do whatever you want, starting a couple years ago, pretty much. Why did you decide to do what you're doing? Why did you decide to talk about storytelling?
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="A">
				<div class="Barack">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Barack</em></span><br>
						Well, one way of looking at what we've both been doing for the not just ten years, but the last 20 years, maybe most of our career was to tell stories.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="A">
				<div class="Michelle">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Michelle</em></span><br>
						Most of our careers once we left law, you know. Sort of the traditional path. 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="A">
				<div class="Barack">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Barack</em></span><br>
						If you want to be in relationships with people, and connect with them, and understand them, and, ultimately, work together with them...
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="B">
				<div class="Julia">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Julia</em></span><br>
						You have to know their story. You have to know them. You have to-- Yeah. That is exactly what we do. When we go in to film something, we don't go in with, like... This is the story. Let's go get it. It's like, Okay, there's something going on here in our community. Like, this big plant is about to close. Looks bad for our community. Let's just not decide what the story is. Let's just go in there, go to the local bar, find people to talk with, sit and listen to them, have a beer with them. To me, a good film interview is all about creating a relationship.  
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="A">
				<div class="Barack">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Barack</em></span><br>
						Yeah, we all have a sacred story in us, right? A story that gives us meaning, and purpose, and how 	we organize our lives. 
				    </p> 
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="A">
				<div class="Michelle">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Michelle</em></span><br>
						How did you guys get into storytelling? 
					</p>
				</div> 
			</div>

			<div class="B">
				<div class="Steven">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Steven</em></span><br>
						We just found in each other, I think, a love of curiosity about people, wanting to connect, wanting to 	be in the world, not wanting to live in, um, a bubble,  but, like, to be out in the real world.  And... a 	love of filmmaking.  
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="B">
				<div class="Julia">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Julia</em></span><br>
						People like the people I grew up with were not really seen in films,  were not really seen in documentaries, on news. Like, in the Midwest, in the heartland of America, you didn't hear from those folks. I'm from a working-class family. You know, my dad was a union man, and I knew we didn't have to worry about the bills being paid, the lights being shut off. But looking at what I see people around us are now facing, they don't have that. 
					</p>
				</div> 
			</div>

			<div class="B">
				<div class="Steven">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Steven</em></span><br>
						And we want to give voice to people who don't appear on-screen. Working people, their stories, their struggles, their hopes. That should be on-screen. Those should be out in the world. Because they're equally compelling to superheroes.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="A">
				<div class="Michelle">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Michelle</em></span><br>
						I mean, those first scenes of, you know, that Midwestern weather opening up and seeing the scenes of those folks on the floor in their uniforms. I mean, that was my story. It's my background. That was my father. What gave him pride and a sense of purpose was that uniform, and that job, and that ability to pay the bills, and to, you know, send us to college. And that was reflected in this film. Um, but it also connects to the power of telling those stories to break down all the things that we think keep us 	apart. 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="B">
				<div class="Julia">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Julia</em></span><br>
						What we always try to do is see everybody's point of view and see that everybody has their reasons. You go to all these different kinds of places. There's two things that you do. One is, you try to be yourself. And the other is you try to connect. You be yourself, and you try to connect. And you listen, and you…
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="B">
				<div class="Steven">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Steven</em></span><br>
						And leave all those preconceived notions of what's the story, who to follow.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="B">
				<div class="Julia">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Julia</em></span><br>
						Be with the person. Be with the person. And don't go in with an idea of what it's supposed to be about.  Because, really, you're finding that out. 
					</p>
				</div> 
			</div>

			<div class="A">
				<div class="Michelle">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Michelle</em></span><br>
						Making people feel like being themselves is okay. And if people don't see themselves out there is the film. It is movies. It's TV. And it's important for us, when we have these platforms, is to do our best to put more stories out there.
					</p>

				<div class="Barack">

						<span><em>Barack</em></span><br>
						If you know someone, if you've talked to them face-to-face, if you know what their story is. you can forge a connection. You may not agree with them on everything, but there's some common ground to be found and you can move forward together. Part of continuing our project of trying to make the 	world a little better for Malia, and Sasha, and your kids, and your grandkids was to put some better stories out there and make sure that we're hearing each other because, if we're doing that, we think that, actually, people end up, you know, coming up with some better answers. So that was our theory. 
					</p>
				</div> 
			</div>

			<div class="A">
				<div class="Michelle">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Michelle</em></span><br>
						And one of the many things I love about this film, this project that you two did together, is that you let people tell their own story. That American Factory doesn't come in with a perspective. It's not an editorial. I mean, you truly let people speak for themselves. And that is a powerful thing that you don't always see happen.
					</p>  
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="B">
				<div class="Steven">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Steven</em></span><br>
						One thing we try to do with the film is give everyone their voice. Even if we disagreed with them, in the filming and the editing, we wanted to make sure that, if they saw the movie, they would say, Okay, yeah. That is my perspective. Fair and honest, even if it may clash with the next person you see. 
				    </p>

			<div class="B">
				<div class="Julia">

						<span><em>Julia</em></span><br>
						Our job, to me, when we go into these situations is to, first of all, connect, be ourselves, make everybody feel comfortable, and come back, and back, and back. This is, again, unlike the filmmaker who flies into something, we live there. We drive over there, 25 minutes from our house. Uh, we're gonna show up. We're gonna show up again. We're not just gonna interview you once. We're not looking for a gotcha. We've never made a muckraking film. Nothing like We're not interested in that kind of film, because I think we're driven by such a sort of curiosity about people, especially going through hard things.

			<div class="A">
				<div class="Barack">

				</div> 
			</div>

			<div class="B">
				<div class="Julia">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Julia</em></span><br>
						Once you get that kind of trust, you don't betray it.

			<div class="A">
				<div class="Barack">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Barack</em></span><br>
						I think one of the things that makes the movie powerful is the fact that it's not all black-and-white. There's a bunch of gray.

			<div class="B">
				<div class="Steven">

						When we approach, When we started talking about, “We're gonna make this movie,” we said clearly, like, we're not gonna make a promo video for the factory. Right. You've gotta give us real access, but we have to have editorial control. Now, admittedly, in the early days, it was exciting. It was, like, these cultures coming together. And you see that in the film. There's a lot of optimism. And we were there. And then, as things got hard, we were still there. And what we found, over the years making documentaries, is people will say, at some point, Yeah, it's getting hard, but you're kind of on the inside now, so you should stay in the room. And we're lucky that people kept that attitude. People trust us with their story, and we try to represent them, and that's a huge responsibility, but we feel so lucky. 	And, with your help, these stories will reach the world.

				<div class="Barack">

						We still got a little pull, you know?

			<div class="B">
				<div class="Steven">
					<p class="name">

						And how are you going to balance documentary and scripted fiction?

			<div class="A">
				<div class="Barack">

						<span><em>Barack</em></span><br>
						You know, I think our theory is: a good story is a good story. If there's a good story to be told, If it's a documentary, like yours, that helps not only to lift up how people are living, but also captures the cultural clash, and grappling with what globalization means in a really intimate way, or if it's, uh a scripted story that you know, in some ways, captures, uh, our common humanity and helps people understand something they didn't understand before, we want to see if we can give voice to that.

				<div class="Michelle">

						<span><em>Michelle</em></span><br>
						Between the two of us, we have an eclectic set of tastes. And Higher Ground is a reflection of both of 	us, so that means that, you know, our-our platform is gonna look a little bit like everything, just like the world is a little bit of everything. So we don't have a particular formula yet. Right. It's just, is it good? 	Does it move us? Will it move the viewers in some way, shape, or form? 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="A">
				<div class="Barack">
					<p class="name">
						<span><em>Barack</em></span><br>
						We want people to be able to get outside of themselves and experience and understand the lives of somebody else, which is what a good story does. And that's why we're calling it Higher Ground. The idea is that, rather than pursuing the lowest common denominator, right? Let's see if we can chase the highest one. Let's see if we can all elevate a little bit outside of our immediate self-interest, and our immediate fears, and  you know, our immediate anxieties, and kind of take a look around and say, You know, we're part of this larger thing. And if we can do that through some storytelling, then it helps all of us, you know, feel some sort of solidarity with each other.
